In the last year, they have all been crashing down/remained steady. Nothing stellar.

In the last 1 year:

-10% for TXN
-4% for IFNNY
-21% for SK
-50% for MCHP
-34% for COHR
-37% for ROHCY (last 6 months)
-43% for ON
-43% for STM
-86% for WOLF.

So to your point the Market Capitalisation of Wolfspeed did crash the most. So yes it is the ""worst"" BUT momentarily only. One could argue that once WOLF's factories are running AND the overall down cycle for ALL SiC semis is finished, then WOLF's stock has the greatest upside potential, which is exactly what I am looking for as an investor. Why would I want to park my money in some stocks with no upside?

My point being that one should really invest outside of SiC semiconductors right now; as a whole, these companies are all in a down cycle. But if you want to prepare the next cycle (as we can all expect an inevitable push towards electrification), I can't see how you would argue against WOLF's upside potential.

Again I'd be curious to know why you expect these other companies to be better stocks to invest into?",1,1745979595.0,RevolutionaryHead208,2025-04-29 23:18:55

Their products are an enabling technology of electrification; traction inverters, fast charging, higher MPGe, HVDC transmission, grid forming inverters, and battery management systems. The stuff that's disrupting the global energy economy.

You can manage that risk by buying a slightly-further OTM put every day (or use longer-term options to hedge creating a ""poor man's covered put"") and collect the premium spread. You might make modest income this way.",9,1745950935.0,theglassishalf,2025-04-29 23:18:59

mprdxm3,1kb3cfb,"I may be crazy - but here me out,  at 10 eastern time exactly - every single day,  the market Fs with you.

I think its because people come into work at 9 - get coffee for an hour,  pull some info - maybe call in some favors to decide if its going to spike up or down.  Then at exactly 10 am every single day the market just spikes - exactly like this.

First though,  it dips in the opposite direction for just a bit as you can see  - to get rid of all those weak stop losses.

This is my conspiracy theory:  between 9:55 -> 10 the market spikes in opposite direction just a hair to scare people into panic selling,  at 10am it goes off in 1 direction for 1.5 hours ... at 11:30 it will reverse back a lot before 12 - 12:30 ( lunch time ),  then it just levels off and the curve smooths or reverses a bit the rest of the day.

Basically im saying time your 10 am... and avoid the panic trap.   Buy at exactly 10:01 am right after the trick play,  then sell before or at 11:30.

mooqi3b,1k5vy0i,"This ain’t just economic turbulence, this is the fallout of decades of elite greed mixed with a delusional man-child now back in the driver’s seat, slamming on the gas in a burning car.

Trump is officially back in office, and what’s the first thing he does? Reignites a trade war with China — like the first one didn’t already drag us through chaos. But here’s the difference: China is not backing down this time. They’ve seen this movie. Last time, Trump announced deals and broke them a week later. “Phase One” was a PR stunt. Tariffs would go up on Monday, come down on Friday, and by Sunday he’s tweeting insults at Xi Jinping. China learned. Now they’re digging in.

And this ain’t just tariffs on luxury items. These are tariffs on core goods — electronics, clothing, home goods, food packaging, everything in your cart at Target. Companies don’t have the margins to eat those costs, so guess who pays? Us. Or worse — your order just sits at the port until you pay the tariff directly, like some kind of customs ransom. That’s already happening. People are calling customer service wondering where their stuff is, and it’s just stuck.

And this was all predictable. The global elite enabled this. They outsourced jobs to China to chase cheap labor, thinking they could absorb a little authoritarianism in exchange for fatter profits. They tried to globalize China into the system — WTO membership, tech transfer, intellectual property deals — because they saw dollar signs. But China played the long game. Now we’re dependent, and Trump is doing what Trump does: blowing up the economy on impulse because it looks good on cable news.

Retailers are panicking. Supply chains are breaking — again. And it’s not just about shipping delays. This is about structural collapse. If companies start relocating warehouses out of China, they’re not just changing addresses. They’re rewriting entire logistics networks, laying off workers, and lowering revenue guidance by 30–40%. That’s market shock territory.

If this keeps going, here’s what it looks like:

Consumer inflation skyrockets — Everything costs more, not because demand is high, but because the supply is throttled.

Unemployment rises — Retail and logistics get hit first. Tech follows. Government contracts dry up.

GDP goes negative — Businesses stop spending. People stop buying. The economy shrinks.

Stocks bleed out — Not a crash, but a grind. Month after month of erosion because nobody can price risk in a world run by chaos.

Public services collapse — Local and federal governments start making cuts. Layoffs in education, infrastructure, and federal agencies.

Populist anger grows — But guess who still gets paid? The billionaires who caused it. The ones that hoarded assets while sending your job overseas in the first place.

So yes, gold miners might still hold up. Maybe. But even that’s shaky. We’re now in a world where America is being run like a tantrum with nukes, and global trade is being dictated by a man who thinks tariffs are just “winning fees.”

We’re not in a downturn. We’re in a controlled demolition.

„Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent denied that the Trump administration is considering unilaterally slashing steep tariffs on Chinese imports, telling reporters Wednesday that high duties imposed by both sides need to come down mutually before talks can begin between the two economies.

He batted down a Wall Street Journal report that the Trump administration is considering slashing steep tariffs on Chinese imports in some cases by more than half as a way of de-escalting tensions and could also be considering a tiered approach.

Bessent said he would be surprised that discussions on slashing tariffs by the administration is happening, noting ""no unilateral offer from the president to de-escalate, not at all.”

momtuki,1k62347,"Sold CC's on all my stocks on the pump.  Close them all for 30-50% on the dump.  Do the inverse for my large SQQQ position.  Not every trade needs to be a 0 DTE put or call.

  
I'm long term bearish, I think that even if tariffs were removed tomorrow, the economic damage has already been done, the trust in USA institutions has crumbled, and we still haven't seen the pain from the domestic policies of the Trump administration.  However, I recognize that even in a bear market there can be face ripping rallies that last for weeks, sometimes months.  Set your levels and risk tolerance.  I don't see any situation in the next 2 years where we breach ATH again (does anyone believe our current situation will be better than where we were in January 2025?).  That is the ceiling.  However, the downside risks are enormous, hence why my largest positions are bear ETFs.

Yeah, I know this is a casino full of degenerates, but you should still understand the risks of buying short dated calls and puts in this environment.  Selling options capitalizes on the high IV and puts theta on your side.  Set reasonable stop losses and close out profits early.",11,1745426138.0,yellowLantern,2025-04-29 23:20:39
