They all came in for the lack of state taxes and huge incentives paid for by the taxpayers. They always pick Austin so they dont have to drive as far to the Governor's mansion collect their payoffs.

As soon as the construction was finished on multiple sites, all three companies fired thiusands of their local employees set to move and transfer to work these places and scaled back their previous promises of big investment.

To boot, Samsung also poisoned the Harris Branch water supply from their factory.  Nvidia will be a rinse and repeat of this folly, exploding the housing market and local cost of living, ruining the environment, and then skipping town when the headlines slow down.

mn094z2,1jyoyk6,"Lmao this will never, ever happen. Redditors need to break outside their echo chambers. If the Euro ever wanted to replace the Dollar’s position, the EU would have to adopt and maintain a trade deficit with the rest of the world in order to satisfy demand, like the Dollar. That’s not going to be possible for the EU to achieve, where exports are already a very significant part of the economy leading the EU to usually run trade surpluses. EU exports make up 52% of the EU’s GDP. US exports make up only 11% of US GDP. The EU is massively more reliant on exports than the US is and it’s much harder for the EU to run trade deficits.

There’s so many other problems that then compound on this. The EU is now expected to massively increase defense spending due to a hostile and imperialistic Russia and an isolationist US. The EU’s awful internal demographics (relative to US demographics) will suppress internal consumption even further, at the same time that Europe’s manufacturing sector is faced with an energy crisis since most of the gas and oil used in Europe is controlled by potential adversaries or autocracies (Russia, US, Azerbaijan, Iran, Gulf Arabs, Libya, Algeria, etc…) and is no longer exactly cheap for their industrial base.

I just don’t see how the Euro could ever fully supplant the dollar as the leading world reserve currency. Too many headwinds against them",159,1744601924.0,DizzyDentist22,2025-04-14 17:34:50

Wolfspeed, Inc. (WOLF) is an AI play that will fly soon. @ $2.17 a share it's at it's bottom(it recently hit it's triple bottom and will go up from here) - should double to $5-$6 very soon since the shorts can't take it any lower it seems.

As soon as Trump enacts the CHIPS act again - which WOLF already won a $750 million grant to(but has been put on a temp hold) - it will really take off again.

The act authorizes roughly $280 billion in new funding to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductors in the United States.

Wolfspeed is a 100% made in the USA chip company, and Trump wants to keep the manufacturing and US employees here - so hopefully we will have an announcement soon, and once it starts it's upward trend, the shorts will have to cover fast.

ah yes the rare but magnificent endangered species, the iron condor. 

currently a rarity due to its low success rate, the iron condor is perfect for when you don't know shit about shit but want to still make trades and feel smart. 

when you can choose neither market direction, timing and definitely not something as lowly and peasant-like as puts or calls directly, simply allow the gusts of windy market volatility to carry you up and down on your iron condor forward. 

In the rare chance of success, your 5% gain will feel magnified 100x since you employed such a genius options strategy, and while you may wonder why you didn't simply buy the one winning side of the trade, know however that there is no complexity or advanced 200iq plays in that. who wants simple gains when you can lock in low or mediocre gains with next level meta strategies with convoluted names. the idea of a heavy metal bird should perhaps warn people as to the success rate of such an idea, however the lack of awareness that enables one to use and brag about using such a regarded options strategy as convoluted as this, also convinces one that it must be an incredibly smart and exceptional strategy, and therefore that they must be incredibly smart and exceptional to be so wise as to employ it. 

and what's better than one iron condor but two?? 

in fact why stop there, if a few birds are good, then an army of them must be better. 

you should simply iron condor ladder your way to gains, summon the flock of metal and let fate do as it pleases.",77,1744655574.0,aeontechgod,2025-04-14 17:35:03
mn3fp8t,1jz47mv,"Think of an Iron Condor like being short 2 spreads:

* On the call side, you are short the 105 call and long the 110 call
* On the put side, you are short the 100 put and long the 95 put

There are a number of ways you can manage an Iron Condor. If your short put leg gets tested, you can manage by:

* Rolling the put side down and out by buying back the short put and selling the long put for a different strike/expiry
* Rolling the call side down for another credit to mitigate any loss on the put side
* Close the put leg altogether by buying back the short put and selling the long put (you can do this in a single order)
* Close the Iron Condor altogether by buying back the short put and short call spreads (you can do this in a single order)

Worse case scenario some legs filled some legs don’t, then you’ll have to exercise your long positions, assuming the short positions are itm, whatever the difference is would be your loss. 

Looking at it most likely the put side will be worthless.

In theory yes. But you have to remember that those companies will have to refinance at some point. Higher treasury yields and higher uncertainty will lead to higher interest on those debts in the long run.

Previously I've looked for things like leveraged EFTs as they get hit harder on the downturn, but bounce back better, companies that have solid business lines, or companies I believe are over-priced but Id like to get onboard longer term.

# Trump Says Tariffs Paused for 90 Days on Non-Retaliating Countries

* Tariffs paused for 90 days on non-retaliating countries, Trump says
* China responds to with an 84% tariff on US products
* EU adopts duties on $23 billion of US goods in metals dispute
* Stocks gain in US trading; Treasury yields climb
* Bessent says bond moves normal, urges China restraint on yuan

# [WSB discord is going insane - hundreds in VC](https://discord.com/invite/wsbverse)

Trump's Full Announcement:

> Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable. Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.

I had many ups and downs like you and I also lost a lot of sleep and had so much stress watching $70k turn into $20K with Trump pumping the market with ""trade talks going well tweets"". I started following Covid in early January watching Agenda Free TV (dorky Steve lookner) keeping track of covid case counts daily. I started getting hope that I would recover as I was watching the value go from 30s into the teens. I kept dollar cost averaging down but in late February when I saw that the market didn't care about Covid, I sold at a huge loss about 70-80% of my initial investment (has around 3000 shares). Well two weeks later the market crashed and twix went from like $12 to  over $999. Well take 3000 x $1000 and that's what I would have ended up with had I held for another two weeks.

Also, you buy in these times - not be bearish. I made the mistake of taking a bearish position in 2003 RIGHT before the 2nd Iraq war started. I got face ripped on my shorts. That was the end of the dot.com era bear market.

I know this is WSB, but if you wanna stay in this game for decades you gotta buy shares of the best, high growth stocks (6-10 diferent stocks will do), build on those positions over time on dips (esp like this dip), and hedge a bit with puts when markets get overbought.

mmarlwm,1jvijnj,"I think this has been the ultimate aim of Trump and his cronies -- to maximize the grift for their own self-benefit. He doesn't care an iota about the issues that rile up his base. He wants to make money, and what better way to do that than with the threat of tariffs moving the entire market at his whim.

We're not talking about them all making a sure-bet 9% on the rise in the market today after the announcement. With creative investing instruments, one could make not only a multiple of that gain, but \*many times\* their original investment. Their are people in the Trump orbit who today turned millions into tens, or even hundreds, on millions.

It's actually pretty smart if you don't have a moral compass and seek the maximum financial advantage, consequences on everyone else be damned.

What else really besides tariffs allows the president to move markets -- both upward and down -- at his will, without instituting any permanent policy? Just on his word, they've discovered now that they can basically send the \*entire\* market up or down about 10%. With insider information ahead of time, one could make almost unlimited proceeds betting before the rise or dip.

Using margin leverage and derivatives, they bet on outlier moves in the market, which normally would be very rare, but here they know they're almost certain to happen with such world-shaking announcements.

This, for them, is like walking up to the roulette wheel 98% certain which number it will hit. And like anyone would, they bet accordingly -- and most of them have a lot to start with.",49,1744240668.0,Thewall3333,2025-04-14 17:37:48

# Trump Says Tariffs Paused for 90 Days on Non-Retaliating Countries

* Tariffs paused for 90 days on non-retaliating countries, Trump says
* China responds to with an 84% tariff on US products
* EU adopts duties on $23 billion of US goods in metals dispute
* Stocks gain in US trading; Treasury yields climb
* Bessent says bond moves normal, urges China restraint on yuan

# [WSB discord is going insane - hundreds in VC](https://discord.com/invite/wsbverse)

Trump's Full Announcement:

> Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable. Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.

Your father will despise you for being retarded. You will hate yourself for being retarded. Your mom left you and your father because she knew you would be retarded.

But remember, never give up. Always keep trying. Always do more.

Instead of losing 17k loose 170k. Always strive for more 🗣️💪
