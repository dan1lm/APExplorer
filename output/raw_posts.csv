1kafx3o,Exclusive | Walmart tells some Chinese suppliers to resume shipments amid trade war: sources,"The American retail giant will reportedly also bear the cost of any new tariffs, after the escalating US-China trade war slowed deliveries to a trickle. 

Some manufacturers in China’s Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces – export powerhouses that have been hit hard by the US-China trade war – have been told by Walmart and other major US retailers to resume shipments in recent days, the Post has learned.

A major exporter of stationery and office products in the eastern city of Ningbo received a notification from Walmart on Monday to resume normal deliveries to the United States, weeks after a series of tit-for-tat tariff hikes between the world’s two largest economies slowed shipments to a trickle.

The costs of the new import duties will be borne by the US clients, the firm said.

Sales were $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion in the fiscal third quarter, the company said in a statement Tuesday. That missed the analyst estimate of $5.35 billion and its own guidance of roughly $5.5 billion. Earnings, excluding some items, came in at 29 cents to 31 cents, compared with an estimate of 53 cents. 

During the period, some customer delayed their decisions, moving sales into the fourth quarter, Super Micro said. The report sent the shares down more than 17% in extended trading.

1kawrjx,Wolfspeed Discussion - Is it a meme stock or a cool mid-term play?,"I've been following Wolf since it was like $6, so not that long.   
I thought it was a good long term play then but didn't buy.

Bought some with leverage at $2.4 and made something on the way, curious what you think about the weird recent action and the earnings call next week. 

Here's what I know so far in a tldr version.   
Might do a fully fledged DD if you regards don't hate too much on the stock because it's borderline meme. 



# Key Challenges

* Mohawk Valley fab at only 20% utilization
* Heavy capex + deep cash burn
* Pending $750M CHIPS Act funding
* 20% workforce reduction amid cost-cutting
* Poor investor sentiment + institutional exits

I get that some of it might make sense given they want to build capacity for the future market of EVs rather than the present. Nevertheless, they burn a lot of cash. Although, there are quite a few catalysts for the short to mid term.

# Catalysts

* **May 2025 Earnings**: Critical turning point for guidance/fab update
* **New CEO Bounce**: Feurle’s credibility may reset the narrative
* **CHIPS Act Award**: Would ease balance sheet pressure
* **Rate Cuts**: Growth names like WOLF benefit most
* **EV Momentum**: 125 EV models using WOLF SiC tech
* **Bonus**: >[40% float shorted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-most-shorted-u-s-stock-is-this-indebted-chip-supplier-b60bc024) = maybe we see some volatile upside?



**Upside Scenario**

**Conditions**: ✔️ Fab ramps above 30% ✔️ CHIPS funding confirmed ✔️ New CEO delivers clarity and vision ✔️ Macro supports capital flows back into growth

  
**Downside Scenario:**  ✔️ Good ol' loss porn  

  
I know it's beaten down as hell, but would it go bust? I doubt it.   
I don't like the previous management, nor their financials, but I'm bullish on the new CEO.  
He's an industry veteran and actually was leading [a proposed acquisition](https://www.wolfspeed.com/company/news-events/news/cree-announces-termination-of-wolfspeed-and-infineon-sale-transaction/) of Wolfspeed by Infineon in 2017, which was shut down from the US gov because the tech is too sensitive. This tells me the guy knows the company for a long time and probably has some strong opinions.

   
Tempted to go Yolo if it drops further.

Thoughts?

1kb4qy9,$META Earnings already priced in — be careful on Calls,"I’ve noticed that when people expect something to happen in the market, they often price in the movement before it happens. It’s harder to make money off of that initial move, but it’s easier to gamble on them being wrong…or less right. 

Especially around earnings time, as we all saw with TSLA, everyone knew their earning would be shit. So the stock moved like shit. Then the earnings were horrendous. And we pumped??? I’m well aware that TSLA is a meme stock and makes 0 sense, but I also believe that there is a lesson in that movement. 

I think there is a possibility of the flip side for META. Everyone thinks they’re going to have good earnings. The forecasts are high and the stock is up (with the rest of the market) in the last few days. 

Furthermore, in the past 10 *straight* quarters META has outperformed earnings estimates. Yet, they do not rise on earnings every time. Additionally, the news of AI advances and AD revenue has already been priced in, in my opinion, so I am doubting that this will affect META movement post earnings.

So, if everyone is *right* and META outperforms? I think we have an after hours pump followed by a market open selloff, from the pump, back to a modest gain. 

If META underperforms? Blood. Many are  expecting META to meet or beat expectations, as it’s done for the past 10 quarters. 

If META meets forecasts? I think there’s a decent chance we see red movement due to a pre-pricing of good earnings. 

To back up this silly little thesis I have a table of META’s earnings reports along side the stock’s movement the week before, movements in after-hours, the following day, and week. 

First thing you’ll notice in this chart is that last quarter the data shows me to be wrong. To my knowledge the news of new ad strategies and AI advancements dropped then which contributed to the gain. The quarter before that however, the data shows me being correct. I also think that the high volatility of this market could heavily contribute to a drop on positive earnings. Look at $SNAP. 

Last thing I’ll add is earnings are always extremely unpredictable like everyone knows. I’m a regard who is trying to recognize a pattern where there may not be one, but god damn it I’ll lose money trying to find one! 

TL;DR 
I believe the market already priced in a positive earnings for META. Looking at past data, it’s possible that even if META exceeds estimates, the stock will drop. And if earnings meet or are below expectations META should be strongly red. I’m not buying calls and would recommend being cautious. Puts could be the move but everything is a lotto around earnings.

1k5vy0i,Retailers I work with are already projecting 30%+ revenue loss over 2025. We haven't even begun to feel the damage from tariffs yet.,"I work at a SAAS company that provides services to retailers that sell things like clothing, home-goods, electronics, shoes etc. Think Levi-Strauss, Adidas, BestBuy.

My POCs are freaking out. One POC said their company is figuring out the feasibility of moving warehouses to other countries to avoid supply chain risk. One company told me their customers are calling them asking where their orders are–the packages are all being held in US ports until the customers ***pay the tariffs for the goods directly.*** Yes, you read that right. These companies are gonna lower revenue guidance by 30%+

Even if Trump and Xi agree to lower tariffs substantially (which seems unlikely to me – Trump has been consistently talking about tariffs on China for decades), I'm not sure how much of the damage can be walked back. Once a company has a freak out about supply chains and tariffs they're going to take action to mitigate risks in case orange face does it again. And there's no chance in hell they're going to be hiring in this kind of risky environment.

I think we're headed for years of negative real GDP growth. Besides unemployment from the retail sector, we're going to have million+ government works laid off by DOGE, and small to medium tech companies are going to lose contracts. (Who's gonna keep paying Hubspot or Monday a few hundred grand a year when GDP growth is negative)

Not much looks investable in this environment. The only thing I like are gold miners (GDX, GDXJ). Even if gold takes a healthy haircut here, the miners are priced as if gold is at like $2000 an ounce, not $3000. These are basically companies that turn oil into gold, and in a deep recession, oil prices will also drop.

1k5sxqo,The Market didn't care about Tesla's Earnings. Here's why. TLDR? It's not rigged,"Everyone’s tripping out about why Tesla is ripping after awful earnings, so here’s what’s actually going on,  and what might happen tomorrow and the next few weeks. Tesla reported after hours. Margins are down, revenue is weak, guidance is fuzzy, and Elon pulled out the usual robotaxi speech, tariffs are bad, cheaper cars, robots making cars.... But instead of tanking, the stock jumped. Why?

Short answer: markets don’t just trade the news,  they trade positioning and expectations.

Here’s how it works:

Before earnings, implied volatility (IV) was high. That means options,  especially puts,  were expensive. Everyone was hedging or speculating on a big drop. If you bought puts, you and everyone else were betting Tesla would move more than the expected range.

But Tesla didn’t crash. It didn’t even dip. It went up.

So tomorrow morning, we will likely see IV crush when IV drops hard after earnings. That’s where Vega comes in. Vega measures how much an option’s price changes in relation to its implied volatility (IV). If you’re holding puts, and IV collapses, those options lose value quickly, even if Tesla trades in your direction or sideways.

Now let’s talk about the feedback loop; this is where things get interesting. Market makers (dealers) are usually on the other side of all those puts. If they sell you a put, they’re taking on directional risk; if Tesla drops, they lose. So to protect themselves, they hedge.

For puts, that means shorting the stock to stay neutral. If the stock drops, their short hedge offsets their option losses.

But if the stock doesn’t drop,  or even worse, it goes up, they have to buy back their hedge to avoid getting wrecked. That buying pushes the stock price higher. And as the stock goes higher, they need to buy more to stay hedged. That’s a gamma feedback loop.

Add in short sellers covering their positions and a few retail traders chasing the pop, and suddenly you have a rally that feeds itself, even if the earnings were bad.

But it doesn’t mean the move is real or sustainable.

The big dogs (institutions) haven’t even acted yet. They’ll dissect the call overnight and into the next day. Some might sell the rip. Some might rebalance slowly over a few days. The real move sometimes doesn’t hit until later.

Let’s be real,  this game isn’t just about puts and calls. Market makers, hedge funds, and institutional players have access to insane levels of data. They have entire teams of quants, analysts, PhDs, and machines that track options flow, gamma exposure, CBOE positioning, bond yields, Fed swaps, commodities, FX correlations; you name it. They don’t just trade the headlines; they trade the reaction to positioning around the headlines. They model the crowd’s behavior before the crowd even makes a move.

If this were as simple as “bad earnings = buy puts,” everyone would be rich. But it’s not. The options market is one of the deepest and most complex systems on the market. That’s why insider trading is illegal, and why billionaires get into politics,  to legally front-run the economy and gain access to real-time information that actually moves markets. That’s why your broker has analytics for gamma exposure, skew, delta hedging zones, not because it’s nice to have, but because it’s necessary if you want to survive in this ecosystem.

Yeah, some retail traders make big money, sometimes,  but that’s gambling. Without context, you’re flipping a coin. 

This wasn’t about fundamentals. It was about positioning, hedging mechanics, and options flow.  
The market punished the crowded trade, as it always does.

So no, the system isn’t rigged. It’s just math, flow, and positioning. The market punishes the crowded trade. Too many people bet on a collapse, so the opposite happened.

Airlines and Hospitality are high fixed cost Industries( the one you still incur with or without revenue); unless you are operating on a very limited service business model, Low contribution margin and high fixed cost are bad for even small variations in load factor and occupancy rates. Break even point is around 60 to 65 percent annualized load factor or occupancy rates for low cost, higher for middle to upper scale. Airlines flagship survive only because of national pride and government involvement . Also, These industries are good proxies to assess if we are in recession, the depth and if we are recovering. By all adjacent metrics ( skilled/quality mix, the one that pay high price, i.e business customers and meeting incentive conference exhibitions) and leisure customer ( low paying) we are already in recession. It will fully show in other hospitality companies, airlines and other industries in Q2 earnings. You may want to check the latest Management discussion and analysis of these companies ( and possible that they stay silent or conservative to avoid stock beating) we are going for a bumpy ride, tariffs or not tariffs unless the US customer can survive with The USA in isolation. Inflation up because of tariffs and unemployment up soon; where is monetary policy going? Stock market, for all stocks may be except nvidia, not enough sustainable catalyst to go in the middle of the 52 weeks range, overall more downside than upside. Stock are going up? sure, option cleaning, just dancing .Update after q2 and q3 earnings release..for full impact. 
Overall, from the Top, a very very bigly bad chess, where the second piece moved was the king, and the king hasn’t stopped moving since in all direction, and the dragon is secretly smiling

1k71daq,A Very Rapid' Drop In Domestic Demand Is Hitting Airlines,"
Complement to a former post. 
Any jump in airlines stock price is just dancing around for now

The Travel crisis that is emerging will affect other industries that profit from tourism, like real estate and Banks

On the international front, for majors Airlines, Chinese and other Asian international tourists are crucial to their long-haul operations. Shanghai Pudong round trip to Dallas-Fort Worth is a common route that is seing drastic decrease for AAL.

A downturn in both leisure and business tourism leads to reduced hotel occupancy rates, lower room pricing, and decreased revenue, particularly in tourist-centric cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, and New York City.

Companies/stock potentially affected: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc., Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. 

Tenet Healthcare (THC) – Dallas, TX maybe affcted too. They owns hospitals and medical centers, some of which attract foreign patients for medical tourism.

Carnival Corporation (CCL) – Miami, FL, world’s largest cruise line, heavily dependent on international tourists, including Chinese travelers.

Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) – Miami, FL, same as Carnival, with an even more aggressive focus on Asia-Pacific expansion, including China-based cruise itineraries.

Airbnb: decrease of international travel and domestic travellers worrying about host calling Ice on them for deportation , just because why not?
Many Buffalo/NY small businesses rely on Canadian spending. If revenue drop, they cant pay rent, if they cant pay rent, landlords cant service mortage debt. More businesses will close like in covid or after covid.

Lennar Corporation (LEN) – Miami, FL, one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S has lot of Chinese buyers: Florida (and Texas) have been targets for foreign real estate investment, particularly by Chinese nationals seeking EB-5 visas or U.S. property. So real estate may be affected too, in this case, may be it will relieve pressure on prices, not sure. But for REITS (real estate investment trusts) that owns properties leased to Hotels and restaurants or Malls or international student housing that depends on international travellers or Transit/transcient business, trouble are ahead in all major US Cities. 

Event Spaces & Convention Centers: A reduction in MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) activities weakens demand for event spaces and the surrounding businesses that support them. ALL major hotels brand affected.

Diversified REITs: These entities, with portfolios spanning retail, hotel, and mixed-use developments in major gateway cities, face indirect impacts from the downturn in tourism and international student presence: Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), BXP, Inc. (BXP)

The third financed asset in size for all major banks after government bonds and other bank is real estate ( commercial and residential)

also, if all foreign countries keep rejecting boeing planes delivery like china, it is the whole aerospace sector that is going down with all of the small industries and SMEs that their business model feeds.

Well no wonder T is saying now: we are discussing with China, but they said: heuuu, no we are not discussing yet. remove all tariffs first, holder of negotiation power is obvious. So until all of this is fixed and factoring at least few months of starring, the crash is coming.

And we have not even talked about the soccer world cup being potentially cancelled in a year by the US, by FiFa or by implicit boycott by countries outside of Usa because not safe and impact on existing contracts with airlines, hotels and hosting cities that have spent millions


All of this might sound exaggerated, but at this point, given what we have been seeing and hearing lately, anything is possible.

I won’t hold a high position when shorting airlines, since they are highly volatile and already close to 52 weeks low. but I will average up a short position.

1kafx3o,Exclusive | Walmart tells some Chinese suppliers to resume shipments amid trade war: sources,"The American retail giant will reportedly also bear the cost of any new tariffs, after the escalating US-China trade war slowed deliveries to a trickle. 

Some manufacturers in China’s Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces – export powerhouses that have been hit hard by the US-China trade war – have been told by Walmart and other major US retailers to resume shipments in recent days, the Post has learned.

A major exporter of stationery and office products in the eastern city of Ningbo received a notification from Walmart on Monday to resume normal deliveries to the United States, weeks after a series of tit-for-tat tariff hikes between the world’s two largest economies slowed shipments to a trickle.

The costs of the new import duties will be borne by the US clients, the firm said.

1k62347,Bessent Says No Unilateral Offer From Trump to Cut China Tariffs,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that President Donald Trump hasn’t offered to take down US tariffs on China on a unilateral basis.

There has been no unilateral offer from Trump to reduce tariffs on China, Bessent told reporters Wednesday in answering questions after a keynote speech at an Institute of International Finance event in Washington.

Trump on Tuesday had said that US tariffs “will come down substantially but it won’t be zero,” and that he didn’t see the need to “play hardball” with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Bessent said that the Trump administration is looking at multiple factors with regard to China beyond just tariffs — including non-tariff barriers and government subsidies. He also said that the strongest relationship between Washington and Beijing is at the top, and that there was no timeframe for engagement. He said that a full rebalancing of trade might take two to three years.

Trump said separately on Wednesday that the US is going to have a fair deal with China.

The Treasury chief also said that the US and India are “very close” on a trade agreement. He reiterated that a satisfactory arrangement doesn’t mean an actual trade document — signaling, as he has before, that initial deals with trading partners will be a broad framework rather than a detailed trade agreement.",1662,0.97,316,1745422253.0,s1n0d3utscht3k,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/bessent-says-no-unilateral-offer-from-trump-to-cut-china-tariffs,False,wallstreetbets,2025-04-29 23:19:19

1k9azf5,Is This Market Bounce a Trap? Rising Risks Could Signal More Downside (April 2025),"The market bounced last week.
But don’t be fooled — this is classic fakeout territory.
Here’s why:

Historical Patterns After Crashes:
- In 2008, the S&P jumped +19% — then collapsed another -28%.
- In 2000, Nasdaq bounced +40% — only to plummet -70%.
- In 2020, a +10% bounce quickly turned into a -35% crash.
→ Early recoveries are often just a setup for the next drop.

Today’s Risks (April 2025):
- Trump’s tariffs on China and global imports continue to rise, creating massive inflationary pressure.
- This will crush margins and slow growth, while keeping the Fed stuck.
- No rate cuts in sight — just higher taxes and stagflation risks.
- Corporate earnings already under strain. Revisions getting ugly.
- Credit stress is rising. Spreads are widening.
- Retail is still all-in, buying this dip with no clear catalyst for recovery.

Bottom Line:
- History shows that first green candles after selloffs are headfakes.
- The market’s core fundamentals are weakening, not improving.
- This rally is probably just short covering and FOMO — not real recovery.
- Real bottoms happen after fear — not wishful thinking.

TLDR:
This bounce is dangerous. With rising tariffs, inflation, and collapsing earnings, the real risk is much lower, not higher.
Stay cautious — don’t get trapped by the rally.",1465,0.92,532,1745778867.0,LimpiXX,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1k9azf5/is_this_market_bounce_a_trap_rising_risks_could/,True,wallstreetbets,2025-04-29 23:19:20
