1jyoyk6,[Leveraged Forex] Betting on the Euro to replace the USD as the world's reserve currency,"[<Imgur link to position>](https://imgur.com/a/C3pBD94)

Ignore the long USD short yuan position, I was bullish the differential between the two until recently, and it'll be gone for more USD.EUR after China reports export data in 5 minutes. I'll probably settle somewhere between 200k to 250k EUR.

Over the last few days, I've started to actually believe that mango man actually believes in his stupid tariff nonsense, which has dramatically changed my outlook on the US economy. Let's lay out the current market situation;

- Treasury yields are spiking despite a huge increase in recession risk
- The dollar is shitting the bed, especially against the euro

There are a variety of reasons people have proposed, like this being a ""treasury attack"" by a sovereign nation. Anyone who tells you this is a ""treasury attack"" is braindead, but hedge funds being told to lay off the basis trades might actually be contributing to the volatility. Anyways, my personal thesis for why treasury yields are going up is simple:

**The market is pricing in that Trump is actually serious about implementing his agenda.** 

Let's look at the facts;

- Trump has infinitely doubled down on the tariff shit at this point. He's staffed the administrative branch and the legislative branch with true believers. He's amassed an extreme amount of economic and foreign policy power in his hands alone, with zero oversight. **If he wanted to actually press forward, he very much could.**
- He genuinely admires McKinley. This in and of itself isn't actually a bad thing, because he was actually a pretty decent president. The issue is that he's fucking LARPing as him and following his tariff playbook 1:1, when the economic situations are completely different. Back then, tariffs actually sorta worked to do what they wanted them to do. And therein lies the issue; **Trump might actually think he's doing the right thing.** Nothing more dangerous than an idealist who think they're doing right.
- Going back to the yields for a second, the US is on a totally unsustainable fiscal path. Spending is at 6.2% of GDP [\(FRED link\)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSGDA188S). That's fucking bonkers for the peacetime USA. And what does the fine president want to do? **Tax cuts.** Brother, what? But wait, there's more!
- **Trump has genuinely accepted he's going to hurt the economy in the short-term and has been building up the political capital to do just that.** Let me repeat that: the USA already has an insane deficit, *in good times*, so ***we're going to actively make things worse.***
- Last time they tried this, they created ~1800 jobs. **At a cost of $815,000 per job.** [Source: American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190611). Good luck selling the US public on this.
- **The administration is jam packed with questionably sane ideologues.** I mean, Navarro, really? The living personification of ""Source? It came to me in a dream."" Holy shit man.
- **The US government has suffered one of the worst brain-drains a modern institution ever has in these last 3 months.** You can think what you want about excessive government, but going about it like this is a joke.

I'm gonna stop here, but you get the gist of it. His current and projected policy paths are genuinely insane when you get down to it. I was on the permabull train just out of raw inertia; I'm Canadian and investing in the USD and levered ETFs over the last 8 years has genuinely changed the trajectory my life. 

So, what's next? Who the fuck knows lmao, but I'm guessing the **Euro**.

It fulfills all the main conditions for a reserve currency: **Capability to run a deficit responsibly, political stability, capable institutions, depth of market/bond market, and no currency controls**. And we're seeing that recently, with a huge shift to EUR-denominated assets in the face of questionable sanity on the US side. I've personally seen enough, so I'm willing to bet on tariff man actually going through with all his shit.

EDIT:
Someone posed a good question about the EU ""trade deficit"" in the comments. Here's my response;

The EU actually did run a trade deficit until 2008, at which point things started really breaking down for them because they weren't ready worth shit for a real crisis. They hard pivoted to exports to band-aid the economy without spending like crazy because the Germans had a hard-on for austerity till 2012. Until very recently they still pushed hard for it, but now we're starting to see the shackles come off with the release of the debt brake and NextGen bonds. That's extraordinarily bullish for their local consumption and demand.

I'd actually argue that the NextGen bonds themselves are one of the most bullish developments in the history of the EU, with them finally having a risk-shared supranational bond for EU fiscal objectives. That's been just one part of greater Union fiscal independence; it's not just some contribution-driven meme ""state"" anymore.

I think it's exactly because their primary strategy of being export-focused has basically no path forward that I think they're gonna at least try to pivot to a domestic consumption economy like the USA. Practically speaking, there's no shot EU exports will ever be able to compete with China's over a long enough period of time, and pretty much everyone can see that. There's no shot the US competes with China's insanely focused industrial policy either, but the US obviously has the domestic economy running (sort of) perfectly.

What's been changing the calculus for me really is that the US policy has gone from ""basically flawless"" to ""basically incoherent"". Genuinely starting a global trade war is way more of a headwind than anything else on your list there is. Energy prices are fixed by a stronger Euro and a (potentially) cratered global economy. Population pressures are fixed by high-quality immigration driven by greater personal consumption and standard of living. There are significant benefits for a resource-poor nation like the EU to push to become a reserve currency; it makes imports cheap as hell proportionally, and dramatically centralizes fiscal power in the EU's hands.

I don't think their situation is nearly as fucked as it's been historically. They don't need to totally supplant the USD, they just need to present themselves as a stable alternative that can actually drive growth, which they've already been pretty successful at; the USD.EUR and the yield spreads between German and US bonds have been generationally positive in the EU's favor these last few weeks.",792,0.88,228,1744599499.0,SongOfTheFates,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jyoyk6/leveraged_forex_betting_on_the_euro_to_replace/,True,wallstreetbets,2025-04-14 17:34:23

1jz3ksy,AI Drug Sector Mania Is Starting On FDA Announcement Of Replacing Animal Testing With AI-based models,"[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-fda-phase-out-animal-testing-drug-development-2025-04-10/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-fda-phase-out-animal-testing-drug-development-2025-04-10/)

**TLDR:** FDA is Ditching Drug testing on animals for AI Drug Models — ABSCI, $RXRX, and $SDGR Bull Run has just started. IMO that this is the year for AI Drug Discovery and it reminds me of how quantum stocks rose.

So the FDA announced Last Thursday that they’re beginning to phase out animal testing for drug development, and replacing it with AI models to simulate how drugs behave in the body, and lab-grown human organoids (little fake livers and hearts made in the lab).

Companies that provide strong non-animal safety data might even get faster FDA reviews.

AI Drug Discovery Stocks started to move on Friday:

* ABSCI Up 13%
* $RXRX up 25%
* SDGR up 17%

Here’s why this is a big deal. AI platforms can drastically reduce the time and cost it takes to develop a new drug. Instead of running lengthy and expensive animal trials, drug companies can now use simulations and organ-on-a-chip models to predict how a drug will behave — and potentially get those results accepted by the FDA. That alone makes these AI tools way more attractive to big pharma(Leading them to outsource to these companies their R&D).

So for Big Pharma it would be very cheap to partner with or license technology from Absci, Recursion, or Schrödinger to run their research of future potential drugs. This adds a new revenue stream for these AI Discovery companies through licensing deals, research collaborations, and long-term co-development partnerships. **Think of it like how Amazon Web Services let companies skip building their own servers — now drugmakers can skip building their own AI drug discovery stack.**

Also, with the FDA giving the green light to non-animal testing, these AI drug discovery companies just became way more attractive as **buyout targets** for big pharma. Instead of building their own AI infrastructure from scratch, it’s now faster and cheaper for legacy pharma giants to just **acquire** platforms like $RXRX, ABSCI, or $SDGR and plug them directly into their pipeline. This regulatory shift makes M&A not only more appealing — but way easier to justify to shareholders.

This is not financial advice, I’m not a financial advisor — just sharing my personal opinion for entertainment and discussion only. Do your own research.

- (positions in hkd)","so follow up to the earlier post, hong kong and china markets are pushing up again today but the move is still being held together by intervention, not clean demand. hsi around 2.5% with tech names leading. hsi tech index gained close to 3%. csi300 about 0.6% and the shanghai comp  around 0.9% But,  the structure hasn’t really changed. behind the move is a quiet restriction from regulators. desks are saying mainland brokers were told to cap net daily selling at 50 million yuan per fund or large retail account. nothing posted publicly but it’s being enforced. broker desks have already warned accounts. if you break it, you get watched or restricted. this is not a free market bounce.

state backed funds like huijin are also active again. buybacks are being pushed. brokerages told to keep the market stable. it’s coordinated. that’s why there’s support, not because money is flowing back in naturally. so thought we had some some relief after the us paused tariffs on phones, laptops and other electronics, covering about 20 categories. that gave tech some breathing room. apple suppliers in taiwan like foxconn and quanta jumped. but trump already said chips are next and even hinted phones might still get hit. pretty sure csi semiconductors index dropped like 1% after that. market reaction is still headline driven, not trend forming.

even with all that, hong kong equities still have room. most of the names mentioned earlier have moved, but some setups still have legs if hsi holds. byd electronic (285) (as people confuse it with byd 1211)  already pushed higher and looks like it could extend. xiaomi has started to tick up with still space to follow. lenovo broke early and is still holding. the bounce isn’t clean but it’s not done either. tradeable, not holdable. structure is intact for now.",73,0.89,21,1744601208.0,Boodiiii,https://i.redd.it/146nu8h3zpue1.jpeg,False,wallstreetbets,2025-04-14 17:34:25

1jwdal8,I all-in'd and held 400k in UVIX for 6 months. I finally sold.,"First off, I would like to preface this with saying my condolences to those who have incurred any losses lately. It has been a very volatile week, and I know many friends and family who have suffered heavy losses in their portfolio and are stressed/anxious for the future to come. With that, I would like to share my experience betting against the American economy by holding one of the most volatile stock for 6 months, UVIX.

As many of you may know, VIX is an index that grows rapidly when the market reverses from a peak. I personally witnessed this during Covid (when TVIX rose almost 2000%) and the recent ""Yen Carry Trade"" of August 5th (when UVIX rose 400%). I've always aspired to time the market successfully with UVIX.

Last year, I felt that the economy was overextended for many reasons. You guys may not agree that these are factors to what led us here, but these are why I ended up taking the biggest risk of my life with such high confidence that the market would crash short-term.

\- US National Debt: We've reached a staggering $36 trillion debt, a large increase of 8 trillion post-covid. To me, this was a huge red flag indicating a looming recession, especially since the market was still pumping.

\- AI Bubble: I think AI is heavily over-hyped, and the rise of NVDA/Tech stocks were not really warranted. I saw this as a bubble bound to pop, much like the dot-com and housing bubble of 2008.

\- Terrible job market: I think we've been experiencing a bad labor market across all sectors for a while now. Employers look to make lay-offs/cost cutting in order to artificially inflate profit margins to boost stock prices, which is not sustainable. I do not believe the numbers released by the Feds at all, they seem suspiciously low compared to real-world experiences of people struggling to find work. This article was one example:  
[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555)

\- Suicide rate is apparently one of the leading indicator of a struggling economy: In 2024, we reached one of the highest rate in the decade [https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades)

\- Trump winning the presidential election: I was aware of his tariff plans during his campaign, and I knew that if he actually did implement these, it would shock the market. It was only a question of if he would actually deliver on his campaign promise or not, which he did.

With all these reasonings in mind, I had a 90% confidence that the market would crash soon, so I YOLO'd my whole portfolio into UVIX after election.

https://preview.redd.it/ovma6m9vj3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd719e0b6d0ff7892d07461aa3eae2312d52caea

Holding this ticker was mentally tough, the market kept rallying from 580 to 620 post-election, and my position was decaying and I was holding a -200k loss for the vast majority of the time. Many people discouraged my position, and some think I should cut my losses. I even isolated myself for a while because I was so sure of my bet. There were two moments when I could have sold to break even: Federal reserve announcing no future interest rate cuts and Trump's initial Canada/Mexico tariffs. But UVIX didn't rise as much as I anticipated, so I kept holding.

https://preview.redd.it/e5e6xfsxj3ue1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f45917088fa769ca5123420f1fec427851fbb2f

Fast forward to last week, Trump announced a severe blanket tariff, which crashed the market as we know it. This was finally the moment I've been waiting for as UVIX went from $20 to $100 in the span of 4 days. I kept my eyes on the news, set my alarm to 6 am to watch the market open. UVIX could rapidly drop/rise in matter of seconds, and I did not want to sell too early/late, so I was shedding 1k shares a day to be safe. 1k at 70, 1k at 90, 2k at 100 on Tuesday. At this point, I had 3k remaining, and I was hoping that UVIX would maybe rise to 140, but then Trump sent out the tweet that he's basically cancelling the tariffs, which shot the market back up, and plummeted UVIX to 40, luckily I was able to salvage and sell at 56 on the way down. It wasn't quite the finish I was hoping for, but overall, I did get to gain roughly 250k off of my 400k bet.

https://preview.redd.it/k4bzie1sk3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=f788c3fce00964a3a5e9f9202b6db85d3f5bda4a

Now that I've been able to cash out on the big -20% SPY crash I've anticipated, I am completely out of UVIX for now. Even if the market continues to fall, I have full confidence that we'll eventually recover back to our previous 620 ATH, so I'll be DCAing into SPXL/TQQQ from this point on until we reach that price.

https://preview.redd.it/8j48yvnul3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=b68d62402c4fdc3ec905d7c036fcd3cee5ff37f1

In the end, I would not encourage anyone else to do what I did. Even with my conviction and accurate market reading, I had to hold UVIX for 6 months, which ended up being one of the most stressful thing I could do. I've lost sleep, became disillusioned with the economy/government, and absorbed more bad news than I could handle. I've internally cheered for bearish news, despite knowing it could mean hardship for many people.

I was somewhat lucky that Trump did indeed enact his tariffs, otherwise I may have been stuck holding a decaying position until it went to zero or was delisted.

In the end, I'm just relieved that I could finally exit my large UVIX positions, and I will never all-in again the way I did. I hoped you all enjoyed my perspective/story and I wish the best of you luck in navigating this volatile market.",5651,0.97,354,1744331806.0,RoyTheRoyalBoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jwdal8/i_allind_and_held_400k_in_uvix_for_6_months_i/,True,wallstreetbets,2025-04-14 17:35:49
